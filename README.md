# alt:V Config Module

## What is this

This is a module allowing it to create simple alt:V resources using `.cfg` files.<br>
It can be used both on clientside and on serverside.<br>
These files use the same format as the `resource.cfg`, `server.cfg` etc.<br>
This module is *not* meant for complex resources, and is meant to quickly and easily create resources.<br>
Even though this module is really simple, it *should be* very fast, as the whole code is parsed to C++ code from the config file.

## How to build

Make sure to fetch the submodules and then run `build.bat`. This will compile the project and copy the created `.dll` into the `dist` directory.
